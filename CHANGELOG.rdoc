= 3.0.7 [2011-08-12] (atzkey)

= 3.0.6 [2011-05-09]
* Fix for AR type conversion for date columns when using plugin parser.

* Namespace copied validator class to ActiveModel::Validations::Timeliness for :timeliness option

= 3.0.3 [2010-12-11]

= 3.0.1 [2010-11-02]
* Generate timeliness write methods in an included module to allow overriding in model class (josevalim)

= 3.0.0 [2010-10-18]
* Rails 3 and ActiveModel compatibility
* Uses ActiveModel::EachValidator as validator base class.
* Configuration settings stored in ValidatesTimeliness module only. ValidatesTimeliness.setup block to configure.
* Parser extracted to the Timeliness gem http://github.com/adzap/timeliness
* Parser is disabled by default. See initializer for enabling it.
* Removed RSpec matcher. Encouraged poor specs by copy-pasting from spec to model, or worse, the other way round.
* Method override for parsing and before type cast values is on validated attributes only. Old version handled all date/datetime columns, validates or not. Too intrusive.
* Add validation helpers to classes using extend_orms config setting. e.g. conf.extend_orms = [ :active_record ]
* Changed :between option so it is split into :on_or_after and :on_or_before option values. The error message for either failing check will be used instead of a between error message.
* Provides :timeliness option key for validates class method. Be sure to pass :type option as well e.g. :type => :date.
* Allows validation methods to be called on record instances as per ActiveModel API.
* Performs parsing (optional) and raw value caching (before_type_cast) on validated attributes only. It used to be all date, time and datetime attributes.

* Fixed date/time selects when using enable_datetime_select_extension! when some values empty
* Fixed ISO8601 datetime format which is now split into two formats
* Changed I18n error value format to fallback to global default if missing in locale
* Refactored date/time select invalid value extension to use param values. Functionality will be extracted from plugin for v3.

* Added :format option to limit validation to a single format if desired
* Matcher now supports :equal_to option
* Formats.parse can take :include_offset option to include offset value from string in seconds, if string contains an offset. Offset not used in rest of plugin yet.
